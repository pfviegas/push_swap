# Push_swap
## Because Swap_push isnâ€™t as natural

The push_swap project focuses on sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. 

The project involves using two stacks, and a specific set of operations to manipulate the elements. We must devise efficient sorting algorithms to rearrange the elements in Stack A while adhering to the project's constraints. These constraints include using only a defined set of swap, push, and rotate operations.

Push_swap aims to teach about algorithm optimization, data structures, and problem-solving in a resource-constrained environment. 

It's a challenging exercise that hones our skills in algorithm design and implementation while considering efficiency and performance.
